It required the specfici use of the D3 javascript library. Labs for this class consisted only of D3 as it is the number one javascript library for building data visualizations.

Lessons Learned: This project taught us how to come up with a concise, clear, and visually pleasing data story. Our data story is told with our thought out text and visuals. We learned that the initial data story we wanted to tell was not backed up by the data. We thought that decades prior to the 2010s would have more popularity and ne conisdered generally better. This intutition was not backed up by our dataset, although that may be due to a bias in the dataset we chose. In terms of software we learned how to create a pie chart, a toggling bar chart, and a circle packing visualization.
